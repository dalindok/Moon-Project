      "shortdescription": "Clean your skin and apply moisturizer to damp skin for better absorption. Use a pea-sized amount, warm it between your palms, and gently massage in upward, outward strokes on your face and neck. Focus on dry areas and let it absorb before adding sunscreen or makeup.",
      "description": "<ol><li><strong>Cleanse Your Skin</strong>: Start with a clean face. Use a gentle cleanser suitable for your skin type and pat your skin dry with a soft towel. Avoid rubbing, as it can irritate the skin.</li><li><strong>Apply While Skin Is Damp</strong>: Moisturizer works best when applied to slightly damp skin. This helps lock in hydration.</li><li><strong>Use the Right Amount</strong>: Take a pea-sized amount of moisturizer for your face. Overapplying can make your skin feel greasy, while too little might not be effective.</li><li><strong>Warm It Up</strong>: Rub the moisturizer between your palms to warm it up. This makes it easier to spread evenly.</li><li><strong>Gently Massage</strong>: Using upward and outward strokes, massage the moisturizer onto your skin. Start from the center of your face (nose area) and move outward toward your cheeks, forehead, and jawline.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Forget the Neck</strong>: Extend the moisturizer down to your neck and d&eacute;colletage using upward strokes.</li><li><strong>Target Specific Areas</strong>: If you have dry patches, apply an extra dab of moisturizer to those areas.</li><li><strong>Allow Absorption</strong>: Give your skin a few minutes to fully absorb the moisturizer before applying sunscreen or makeup.</li></ol>"

      "title": "Why do we have to use sunscreen?",
      "shortdescription": "We use sunscreen to protect our skin from harmful UV rays, which can cause sunburn, premature aging, and skin cancer. It helps keep our skin healthy and safe.",
      "description": "Sunscreen is essential for protecting the skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) rays emitted by the sun. UV rays are categorized into UVA and UVB, both of which can damage the skin. UVA rays penetrate deeply, causing premature aging and wrinkles, while UVB rays primarily cause sunburn. Over time, excessive UV exposure increases the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Sunscreen forms a protective barrier that absorbs or reflects these rays, preventing damage. It also helps maintain even skin tone and prevents hyperpigmentation, keeping the skin healthier and youthful."

      "shortdescription": "Using a sheet mask daily keeps your skin hydrated, nourished, and glowing, while improving texture and addressing dryness or dullness.",
      "description": "Using a sheet mask daily can significantly enhance your skin’s hydration, brightness, and overall health. These masks are soaked in nutrient-rich serums that penetrate deeply into the skin, addressing concerns like dryness, dullness, and uneven texture. Unlike creams or lotions, sheet masks provide intense, targeted hydration and nourishment. They also create a barrier, allowing the serum to absorb more effectively. Incorporating a sheet mask into your routine every day can refresh and rejuvenate your skin, making it look more radiant and youthful over time."
